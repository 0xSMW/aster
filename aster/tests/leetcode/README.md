# Aster LeetCode Hard Suite

This directory contains deterministic algorithm tests written in native Aster.

## Run

From the repo root:

```bash
aster/tests/run.sh
```

Contract:
- each `*.as` file must compile and run successfully (exit code 0)
- each file contains `main()` that runs multiple cases and returns non-zero on the first failure
